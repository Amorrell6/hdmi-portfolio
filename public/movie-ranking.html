<h1>The Best Movies According to Amanda</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy</h3>
<p>I love the characters, the action, and the comedy.</p>

<h3>Dead Alive</h3>
<p>This movie is ridiculous. Low budget comedy/horror with lots of over the top gore.</p>

<h3>House of 1000 Corpses</h3>
<p>Always a fan of Rob Zombie. Love his music and his movies. This one is a one of a kind horror film and was actually scary compared to most new horror films out now. </p>
